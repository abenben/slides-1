## 2013: Association

* Purpose: We have established a legal entity to make it easier to manage money and contracts for PyCon JP event 
* I have been a director since 2013

## 2014-1016: Chair od PyCon JP event

* I was the chair of PyCon JP event from 2014 to 2016
* Purpose: Open management
* I opened every staff meeting to make it easier for new staff to join
* We created an operation manual and made it reusable
* We regularly publish our activities on the blog to get interested in event management

## 2015-: PyCon mini
* Small PyCons in the region were held in Sapporo and Hiroshima in 2015
* It has been held in various places such as Kumamoto and Osaka
* PyCon Kyushu is held all over Kyushu(Fukuoka -> Okinawa -> Kumamoto)
* We have been sharing operating know-how and supporting money and people
* We have also provided a subdomain of pycon.jp

## 2016-: Python Boot Camp
* Objective: We visit all over Japan to teach Python → We connect with local people → We hope local communities to start up
* We teach an introduction to Python programming in half a day
* We hold 40 times in 3.5 years with 950 local participants
* We hold in cooperation with local staff and local teachig assistants
* Result: Some local communities have been created
* PyCon JP has more people coming from local area

## 2019: Python Boot Camp Caravan, Regional Meetup
* Purpose: To strengthen the connection between local communities
* A regional meetup was held at PyCon JP 2019 with local community members
* About 30 people gathered from all over Japan for this event
* We had various discussions and shared ideas and worries
* We hold local meetups online
* We hold the first online meeting using Zoom, with 15 participants from all over Japan

---

## Future

* We want to hold PyCon JP outside of Tokyo
* We want to conquer all prefectures at Python Boot Camp
* We want PyCon mini to be held all over Japan

---

## Summary

* We have spread Python throughout Japan with various activities
* I think it's important to meet
* First we go to meet local people
* Reunion strengthens relationship
